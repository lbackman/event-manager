Event Manager

Part of The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails full stack curriculum.

The main concepts implemented in this program:
- Reading csv files
- Use an API to access data
- Use said data to populate templates via ERB

The program itself looks up the zipcode of each attendee and the uses the API to get the representatives for that area. Then, each user recieves a thank you letter with their personal information and the names and websites of their representatives.
